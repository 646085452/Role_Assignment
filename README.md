# Role Assignment Program

## Description
Assign roles to players in two groups, determining "traitors" and "good persons" with optional pre-determined traitors and position assignments. Notifications with assignments are sent to players via email.

## Requirements
- Ensure the `.exe` file and `email.txt` file are in the same directory before running the program.

## How to Use

### 1. Setup
Place `Role_Assignment.exe` and `email.txt` in the same directory.

### 2. Input Player Details
- Run `Role_Assignment.exe`.
- Enter player names and emails when prompted.
- Choose to add or delete players from the list or continue without modifications.
  
### 3. Set Group Sizes
- Input the number of players for Team 1 and Team 2. Ensure numbers are greater than 0.
  
### 4. Assign Traitors (Optional)
- Optionally, pre-determine a traitor by inputting a player's name when prompted.
- Note: If utilized, the predetermined traitor’s name should be in the emails list. Failing to ensure this will terminate the program.

### 5. Select Players
- Choose names from the provided list for Group 1 and Group 2.
- Ensure that, if a traitor was pre-determined, their name is first on one of the teams’ lists or the program will terminate.

### 6. Set Traitor Numbers
- Determine the number of traitors in Team 1 and Team 2.

### 7. Assign Positions (Optional)
- Optionally, assign positions to players (e.g., top, mid, jg, ad, sup).
- Customize the positions if desired and determine if they should be unique.

### 8. Email Notifications
Once assignments are complete, role notifications are sent to the players' respective email addresses.

## Note
Ensure players are aware of the random assignment and any predetermined roles. Use responsibly and in a fun, consensual gaming environment.
